# overview

I have created this carousel using pain HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT . Where we gonna have an custom slider that slides through all of the featured products that is present in overall slide.

# infinite-scrolling

It slides infinitely through all of the mentioned products . The logic that i have used to look in it in infinite manner is, I have adjusted few last element of the slide at the beggining and few starting element of the slide at last to look it in infinite manner.

I have used eventListeners to handle the click events on the left and right arrow.
